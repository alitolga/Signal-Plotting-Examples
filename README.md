# Signal Plotting Examples

These 2 python scripts are the 2 questions of my first homework in my Signals and Systems class. I took the class in my 3rd year in ITU CE.

The 1st python scripts creates and plots 3 different signals using cosine and exponential functions.
The 2nd python script creates and plots 2 different beat signals by adding 2 cosine signals with frequencies close to each other.
